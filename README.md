# facebook-picture-deleter

A small midnight projects to avoid the tedious process required to delete pictures from my Facebook profile.
It utilizes Java's Robot class, which is basically a click bot.
For this to run, you will have to manually enter the coordinates of each button to be clicked by the
Facebook Picture Deleter before running it.

On Ubuntu, simply run `xmag` from terminal, this little tool will help you find required coordinates.
As this clicker is only like a recording of your movement/clicks, once you start the program, avoid touching your mouse
or scrolling the browser, as this would change the content at the actual coordinates you set.

*Note:* Some contends of your album may appear to be pictures, but you can not delete them. Try to set the coordinates,
so this kind of pictures get avoided.
Detailed description may be found in the `FbPicDelGoBrrr` class.

## Prerequisites to run this program
